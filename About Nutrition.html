        <p class="para">
          Nutrition, nourishment, or aliment, is the supply of materials - food - required by organisms and cells to stay alive. In science and human medicine, nutrition is the science or practice of consuming and utilizing foods.

          In hospitals, nutrition may refer to the food requirements of patients, including nutritional solutions delivered via an IV (intravenous) or IG (intragastric) tube.
          
          Nutritional science studies how the body breaks food down (catabolism) and how it repairs and creates cells and tissue (anabolism). Catabolism and anabolism combined can also be referred to as metabolism. Nutritional science also examines how the body responds to food.
          
          Fast facts on nutrition
          -The human body requires seven major types of nutrients.
          -Not all nutrients provide energy but are still important, such as water and fiber.
          -Micronutrients are important but required in smaller amounts.
          -Vitamins are essential organic compounds that the human body cannot synthesize.
          <br><br>
          Nutrition is the study of nutrients in food, how the body uses nutrients, and the relationship between diet, health, and disease.

Major food manufacturers employ nutritionists and food scientists.

Nutritionists may also work in journalism, education, and research. Many nutritionists work in the field of food science and technology.

There is a lot of overlap between what nutritionists and dietitians do and study. Some nutritionists work in a healthcare setting, some dietitians work in the food industry, but a higher percentage of nutritionists work in the food industry and in food science and technology, and a higher percentage of dietitians work in healthcare, corporate wellness, research, and education.

          <strong>Types</strong><br><br>
          A nutrient is a source of nourishment, a component of food, for instance, protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamin, mineral, fiber, and water.
<br>
Macronutrients are nutrients we need in relatively large quantities.<br>
Micronutrients are nutrients we need in relatively small quantities.<br>
Macronutrients can be further split into energy macronutrients (that provide energy), and macronutrients that do not provide energy.<br><br><br>

<strong>Energy macronutrients</strong><br><br>
Energy macronutrients provide energy, which is measured either in kilocalories (kcal or calories) or Joules.<br><br> 1 kilocalorie (calorie) = 4185.8 joules.<br><br> Energy macronutrients include:<br>

Carbohydrates - 4 kcal per gram
<br>
Carbohydrate molecules include monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose), disaccharides, and polysaccharides (starch).
<br>
Nutritionally, polysaccharides are favored over monosaccharides because they are more complex and therefore take longer to break down and be absorbed into the bloodstream; this means that they do not cause major spikes in blood sugar levels, which are linked to heart and vascular diseases.
<br>
Proteins - 4 kcal per gram
<br>
There are 20 amino acids - organic compounds found in nature that combine to form proteins. Some amino acids are essential, meaning they need to be consumed. Other amino acids are non-essential because the body can make them.
<br>
Fats - 9 kcal per gram
<br>
Fats are triglycerides - three molecules of fatty acid combined with a molecule of the alcohol glycerol. Fatty acids are simple compounds (monomers) while triglycerides are complex molecules (polymers).
<br>
Fats are required in the diet for health as they serve many functions, including lubricating joints, helping organs produce hormones, assisting in absorption of certain vitamins, reducing inflammation, and preserving brain health.
